# Machine Learning Clojure

## Inspiration

This project was created in order to practice examples from [Clojure for machine learning](http://www.bokus.com/bok/9781783284351/clojure-for-machine-learning).
I am also going through the [Machine Learning by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome).

## Linear regresion data

I used [Random linear regression kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andonians/random-linear-regression).
